# Azure Static Web Apps

Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.

The workflow of Azure Static Web Apps is tailored to a developer's daily workflow. Apps are built and deployed based on code changes.

When you create an Azure Static Web Apps resource, Azure interacts directly with GitHub or Azure DevOps to monitor a branch of your choice. Every time you push commits or accept pull requests into the watched branch, a build automatically runs and your app and API are deployed to Azure.
