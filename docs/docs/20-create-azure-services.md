# Create Azure services

## Deploy Azure services

The following services will be created in your Azure subscription:

1. [Azure Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/form-recognizer?WT.mc_id=aiml-77396-cxa).
1. [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?WT.mc_id=aiml-77396-cxa).
1. [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/static/?WT.mc_id=aiml-77396-cxa).

## Open a terminal window in VS Code

From VS Code, select <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+`</kbd> to open a new terminal window.

### Create the Azure Patient Registration Services

From the terminal window, run the following commands to create the Azure Patient Registration Services.

1. Authenticate to Azure by running the following command. Note, it may take up to 30 seconds for the `azd login --use-device-code` command to complete.
    
    ```bash
    azd auth login --use-device-code
    ```

1. Initialize your Azure environment with the following command.

    ```bash
    azd init
    ```

1. Create an environment name. For this workshop, the environment name must be globally unique. Create a unique environment name by appending a random six digital number after **contoso-health-app-NNNNNN**, for example, **contoso-health-app-318721**. But don't use the example name, use your own.

1. Deploy the Azure services with the following command.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```

1. Select a region (e.g: **eastus**).
1. Select your subscription.

    :::note

    It will take approximately 5 to 10 minutes to deploy the Azure services. So now is a great time to grab a cup of coffee or tea or read the next section of the workshop documentation.

    :::

    :::tip

    - You can only have one free Azure Form Recognizer service in your Azure subscription.
    - If your azd environment fails to deploy, you can delete the environment by deleting the `.azure` folder in the `contoso_new_patient_app` folder.

    :::

1. The output from the `azd up` command will look similar to the following.

2. Make a note of your `Resource group` and `Storage account` names, as you'll need them in the next section of the workshop.

    ```bash
    Resource group: rg-contoso-health-app-NNNNNN
    Storage account: storagexxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

3. Leave VS Code Codespace open, as you'll need it in the next section of the workshop.
